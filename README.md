## Yami Web

The other side of a web. That only someone who knows. and only a few people understand the meaning of this paragraph.

Hmm~ Just kidding wkwk.

In short, this website is the same as an anime streaming/download site.

BUT! due to resource limitations... This website only has a few features, including:

- Show anime in this seasons
- Show detail's of anime
- Download link for each anime episode
- ~ ~ ~ anime batch
- ~ ~ ~ anime movie<br>
  and many more.

Do not be sad (^-^), for you Linux users. You can still watch anime via the terminal. Besides being cool, it can also save memory RAM. What are you waiting for? Let's clone [Samehadaku-CLI](https://github.com/Hanivan/Samehadaku-CLI)
